# DataBase-of-Fruits
Interface for local database written in C# + WindowsForms + MySQL
Two forms: database editor login and database editor.
Implemented the following:
- Show database (display the entire table)
- Add to database (add new database element)
- Delete from the database (delete a specific database element)
- Refresh database (update specific values of a specific db element)
  
obviously, everything is through sql-requests..

\maybe update\
